Developing and managing efficient and effective database applications requires understanding the fundamentals of database management systems, techniques for the design of databases, and principles of
database administration. This workshop is designed to provide a foundation in data management concepts and database systems. It includes basics of databases, representing information with the relational database model and manipulating data with MS Access. Also. few exercises to practice your understanding

We will be using the Microsoft Access tool for designing and creating our own databases, along with designing queries for data manipulation. The MS access tool will be free for all UIC students and the installation for the tool will be provided in the Setup page.
